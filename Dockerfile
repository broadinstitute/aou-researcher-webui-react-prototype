# Create a simple file to handle heath checks. Health checking can be disabled
# in app.yaml, but is highly recommended. Google App Engine will send an HTTP
# request to /_ah/health and any 2xx or 404 response is considered healthy.
# Because 404 responses are considered healthy, this could actually be left
# out as nginx will return 404 if the file isn't found. However, it is better
# to be explicit.
